# PLAN.md

## Project

OpenIssue

## Objective

Build a convincing, end-to-end GitHub issue triage assistant that helps maintainers process noisy issues faster through:

- issue classification
- duplicate detection
- priority scoring
- label suggestion
- missing-information detection

This plan assumes a **fully open-source model path** for the current phase.

---

# 1) Product framing

## 1.1 Core problem

Maintainers waste time on:

- duplicate issues
- vague bug reports
- unprioritized issue queues
- missing labels
- noisy low-quality reports

## 1.2 Core promise

Given a GitHub issue, OpenIssue should help answer:

- What kind of issue is this?
- How urgent is it?
- Is it likely a duplicate?
- What labels should be applied?
- What information is missing?

## 1.3 Primary target user

Repository maintainers.

## 1.4 Non-goals for MVP

Out of scope unless explicitly re-added later:

- generic GitHub profile analytics
- contributor social graphs
- broad repo health dashboards
- complex RBAC systems
- enterprise audit/logging platforms
- multi-provider issue systems beyond GitHub

---

# 2) Locked technical decisions

## 2.1 Frontend

- Next.js
- TypeScript
- dashboard-style triage UX

## 2.2 Backend

- Python
- FastAPI
- modular analysis pipeline

## 2.3 Embeddings

Primary:

- `BAAI/bge-small-en-v1.5`

Fallback:

- `sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2`

## 2.4 Vector search

Use a free/local vector solution with persistent storage.
Keep the vector layer swappable behind an interface.

## 2.5 Analysis strategy

Hybrid, not embedding-only:

- semantic retrieval for candidate recall
- heuristics for classification and priority
- heuristic reranking for duplicate precision
- optional reranker model later if needed

## 2.6 API style

Structured JSON contracts between frontend and backend.
The frontend should never contain hidden business logic for analysis.

---

# 3) System design

## 3.1 High-level flow

1. ingest GitHub issues from a repository
2. normalize issue text
3. generate/store embeddings for historical issues
4. analyze a target issue
5. retrieve similar historical issues
6. classify issue type
7. compute priority score
8. generate label suggestions
9. detect missing information
10. return structured triage result to frontend

## 3.2 Architecture

Frontend (Next.js)
→ Backend API (FastAPI)
→ Issue ingestion layer
→ Embedding provider
→ Vector retrieval layer
→ Heuristic analysis layer
→ Result formatter
→ Frontend render

## 4.5 Duplicate analysis module

Responsibilities:

- generate candidate duplicates
- rerank candidates
- assign duplicate confidence
- explain why candidates are similar

Pipeline:

1. retrieve top-k by vector similarity
2. compute rerank features
3. produce final ordered duplicate list

Rerank features may include:

- title token overlap
- shared stack trace fragments
- shared error code / exception name
- shared filenames / modules
- shared version strings
- shared labels / components
- recency / status adjustments

## 4.6 Classification module

Responsibilities:

---

# 10) Heuristic design notes

## 10.1 Duplicate detection heuristics

Candidate features:

- title n-gram overlap
- body keyword overlap
- exception/error token overlap
- filename/module overlap
- version overlap
- label overlap
- semantic similarity
- issue state/recency adjustments

Output should include reasons such as:

- “same exception name”
- “same module path”
- “very similar title phrasing”
- “same version range mentioned”

## 10.2 Classification heuristics

Examples:

- bug → words like error, crash, broken, expected/actual, reproduce
- feature_request → request, proposal, add support, enhancement
- documentation → docs, typo, readme, guide, example
- support_question → how do I, help, usage question, configuration question
- spam_or_noise → very short, off-topic, promotional, incoherent

Historical nearest neighbors can strengthen category evidence.

## 10.3 Priority heuristics

High-value positive signals:

- crash
- auth failure
- security issue
- regression
- data loss
- production broken
- many similar issues
- strong repro steps

Negative or dampening signals:

- low-information request
- support-style question
- vague issue with no evidence
- cosmetic/non-blocking language

## 10.4 Missing-info heuristics

Flags:

- no repro steps
- no expected/actual split
- no environment info
- no version info
- no logs/screenshots for error issue
- body too short

---

# 11) Evaluation plan

## 11.1 What “good” means for MVP

The system should be judged on whether it helps a maintainer make a faster decision.

A good result should:

- identify a plausible type
- surface useful duplicate candidates
- assign a reasonable urgency
- explain itself
- feel actionable

## 11.2 Manual evaluation checklist

For sample issues, ask:

- are top duplicate candidates reasonable?
- is the priority band defensible?
- are suggested labels plausible?
- does the system catch weak issue reports?
- do explanations feel trustworthy?

## 11.3 Demo-quality threshold

Do not chase benchmark purity at the cost of shipping.
A believable, explainable, usable system beats an overbuilt one.

---

# 12) Risks and mitigations

## Risk 1: embedding quality is not enough

Mitigation:

- use heuristic reranking
- preserve lexical anchors
- tune candidate generation
- keep model swappable

## Risk 2: GitHub issues are noisy

Mitigation:

- normalize input
- strip obvious clutter
- focus on title + body first
- detect low-information issues explicitly

## Risk 3: too much time spent on infra

Mitigation:

- keep stack minimal
- avoid overbuilding auth or deployment
- choose local-first free tooling

## Risk 4: frontend becomes a fake shell

Mitigation:

- integrate only against real backend responses
- prefer one real panel over many fake pages

## Risk 5: scope drift

Mitigation:

- return to the three MVP pillars
- classify
- detect duplicates
- score priority

# 13) Definition of success for the hackathon

Success is not “we built a lot.”

Success is:

- real GitHub issue ingestion
- real analysis path
- real similar-issue retrieval
- real priority scoring
- real triage UI
- clean README and setup
- convincing demo story

---

# 14) Open follow-ups for later

Not for current implementation unless explicitly prioritized:

- webhook-triggered auto triage
- auto-comment suggestion generator
- reranker model beyond heuristics
- feedback loops from maintainer label corrections
- multi-repo indexing
- better issue-template parsing
- auth polish
- hosted deployment hardening

---

# 15) Active execution update (Wave 1: GitHub ingestion)

## Current goal

Implement the real backend issue-ingestion path for `feat/w1-github-ingestion` by fetching repository issues from GitHub, normalizing to a stable internal contract, and exposing a list endpoint.

## Exact scope

- build a GitHub API client for issue listing
- normalize GitHub issue payloads into `NormalizedIssue`
- build canonical text from title + body
- filter pull requests from the issues feed by default
- expose `GET /api/issues` to return normalized issues for a repo

## Files/components likely affected

- `services/api/app/main.py`
- `services/api/app/github/client.py`
- `services/api/app/github/normalization.py`
- `services/api/app/routes/issues.py`
- `services/api/app/schemas/issues.py`
- backend dependency/config docs as needed

## Sequencing

1. scaffold backend API structure and schemas
2. implement GitHub API client with robust error handling
3. implement normalization and PR filtering behavior
4. expose `GET /api/issues` using normalized output
5. run backend and verify endpoint on a sample public repo

## Validation strategy

- run FastAPI server locally
- call `GET /api/issues` for a real public repository
- verify canonical text shape and required metadata fields
- verify pull requests in the issues response are filtered/handled correctly

## Risks / open questions

- GitHub rate limiting for unauthenticated requests
- pagination limits (single page vs multi-page fetch) for large repositories
- choosing a stable URL representation while preserving raw metadata

## Explicitly out of scope

- full auth system or OAuth flows
- embeddings, duplicate detection, classification, or priority logic
- frontend analytics and non-triage dashboards
